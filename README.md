# Tanks!
## Synopsis
In Tanks! you must destroy other tanks while trying to avoid
being destroyed yourself! Reach the score limit to win.

## Motivation
This game was created independently for a Game Development course at the University of San Francisco. The concept was to create a game involving tanks and the implementation was left to our creativity. 

This game is based on a free-for-all deathmatch mode where each tank kill nets you a point and reaching the point limit wins you the game.

The game was written in C++ using the OGRE graphics engine.

*Note: This repository was moved from a previous SVN repository*
